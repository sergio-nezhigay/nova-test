Nova Poshta API Endpoints for City and Warehouse Selection

To implement an autocomplete for cities and then list their warehouses, you will use Nova Poshta’s JSON API (entry point https://api.novaposhta.ua/v2.0/json/
novaposhta.ua
). Key methods are getCities (to search cities) and getWarehouses (to list branches). For example:

Search cities by name: Use the getCities method (model "Address") with a "FindByString" filter. This loads the directory of Ukrainian cities with Nova Poshta offices
scribd.com
. In practice you would POST JSON like:

{
  "apiKey": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "modelName": "Address",
  "calledMethod": "getCities",
  "methodProperties": {
    "FindByString": "Київ"
  }
}


The response returns matching city records (each with a Ref ID)
scribd.com
. Important: the FindByString search only works with Ukrainian names
scribd.com
, so be sure the user’s input is in Ukrainian.

Alternative: Nova Poshta also provides the searchSettlements method (model "Address") for online searching by partial city/settlement name or postal code
scribd.com
. This can be used similarly, e.g.:

{
  "apiKey": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "modelName": "Address",
  "calledMethod": "searchSettlements",
  "methodProperties": {
    "CityName": "київ"
  }
}


This returns settlement records whose main description matches (e.g. "MainDescription":"Київ") and includes the settlement’s Ref. You could then use that Ref in the next step.

List warehouses in the selected city: Once a city is chosen, call getWarehouses to retrieve its branches. The API allows filtering by the city’s reference or name
scribd.com
. For example, using the city’s Ref from above:

{
  "apiKey": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
  "modelName": "Address",
  "calledMethod": "getWarehouses",
  "methodProperties": {
    "CityRef": "<SELECTED_CITY_REF>",
    "Language": "UA"
  }
}


This returns all warehouses in that city. (You can also pass "CityName": "Київ" instead of CityRef; the API supports both
scribd.com
.) Including "Language":"UA" ensures that the warehouse details come in Ukrainian
awd.in.ua
. Each warehouse object in the response has its own Ref, address fields (Description/ShortAddress), etc., which you can display for the user to choose.

In summary, your first fetches will be: (1) search cities with Address/getCities (or Address/searchSettlements), and (2) fetch warehouses with Address/getWarehouses (filtering by CityRef or CityName). All requests must include your API key and be sent as JSON to Nova Poshta’s endpoint
scribd.com
scribd.com
.

Questions/Clarifications:

Do you want to use searchSettlements (Address model) for autocomplete instead of getCities? It accepts partial city names or postal codes for online search
scribd.com
.

When listing warehouses, will you use the Ref ID of the chosen city or its name? (The API supports both filters
scribd.com
, but using CityRef is recommended after a city search.)

Nova Poshta’s examples use both "Address" and "AddressGeneral" as modelName. For consistency, do you have a preference? (For instance, some examples call AddressGeneral/getWarehouses with "Language":"UA"
awd.in.ua
.)
